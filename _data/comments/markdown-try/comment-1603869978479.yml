message: "First of all I want to say awesome blog! I had a quick question in which I'd \r\nlike to ask if you do not mind. I was interested to know how you center yourself and clear your mind prior to writing.\r\nI've had difficulty clearing my mind in getting my ideas out.\r\nI truly do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 \r\nto 15 minutes are usually lost simply just trying \r\nto figure out how to begin. Any ideas or tips? Cheers!"
