message: "Pacific brands swings to profit bradken loss widens, while a new record for the UK's largest online retailer\n\nRival chain Marks & Spencer said Monday it had recorded a Â£60m profit for the second quarter of 2015.\n\nThe retailer, which runs most of the Marks and Spencer brand-name stores in Britain, reported sales of Â£23.2bn in the latest three months.\n\nSales rose by almost 8% to Â£1.8bn and helped Marks & Spencer record a Â£59.5m profit. This was followed by a 5.5% rise in profits for the same period last year.\n\n\"We have not seen the growth in sales recorded in the past couple of years but we are investing more in the store to ensure we can sustain the positive sales growth we have seen since our entry into the UK in 2006,\" said Simon Jones, president of The British Retail Consortium, referring to the UK's leading online retailer and the country's third largest clothing retailer.\n\nMarks & Spencer was boosted by a favourable tax rate and sales growth last year that was twice that of rivals J Crew and H&M.\n\nHowever, sales at the British retailer fell year-on-year in the two months to September, partly driven by a 2% fall at its UK branch of TJX.\n\nMarks & Spencer is also taking steps towards selling online through its website store but Jones said there was no imminent plans to do so.\n\nHe said the retailer had no plan to open any more branches in the UK.\n\n\"We look forward to providing customers with an opportunity to have more choice and to invest in more services such as online shopping and online loyalty programmes that will help us compete against global retailers such as Dixons, Luscious, Louis Vuitton and JCPenney,\" he added. \r\n[url=https://www.water-blogged.com/]더킹카지노[/url]\r\n[url=https://www.gohappyclub.com/]온라인카지노[/url]\r\n \r\nAust ambassador held in manila mall siege report says hostage takers told hostage negotiators they would kill US diplomats if they got into room with hostages and not Americans\n\nMall siege: Manila: Philippine ambassador held in manila mall siege is reportedly alive but has been questioned by police about how he got locked in the centre of the complex by gunman\n\nThe US embassy was evacuated from the main building of the complex.\n\n\nThe incident took place as US State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Washington did not believe the man inside the US embassy was the person behind the assault.\n\n\n'We have no indication that this is the person who caused the attack on the US embassy,'' Toner said Monday. 'In fact, we have no indication that anyone in the Philippines has carried out this attack on our embassy.'\n\nUS ambassador to Manila Danilo Santiago is held by armed groups who have been trying to take over his home in a district of Manila.\n\n\nA police spokeswoman said the Philippines government was investigating the incident.\n\n\nThere is uncertainty as to why the gunman entered the embassy.\n\n\nThe suspect was believed to be either in his 30s or 40s and was wearing a black hooded coat or robe, police said.\n\n\nUS Embassy Manila has closed the main entrance to the compound and all diplomatic offices have been sealed off while officials are examining the situation, a US State Department spokesman said.\n\n\nThe US embassy has been closed as the Philippine State Security Bureau assesses a hostage situation"
