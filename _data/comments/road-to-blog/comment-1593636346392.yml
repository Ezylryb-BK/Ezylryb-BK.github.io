If I'm asked to join, I think I've made my mark there, if not, great.

Anderson, 32, had been on duty at the gate at the Hudson River Airport for less than 45 minutes when he intentionally crashed a jet skid into a jet taxi and crashed into the jet-ski boat near the parking area.\n\nAnderson, of Hudson, appeared in Municipal Court with an attorney on his behalf Monday, where he was ordered not to have any contact with the victim until he gets his day in court Wednesday.\n\nThe first of two preliminary hearings will continue Wednesday after Anderson's court-appointed attorney failed to have the hearing held.\n\nAnderson was arrested at an undisclosed location and he will be arraigned in Municipal Court, where he faces a number of counts related to the March 18, 2015 crash.\n\nAn investigation is ongoing, and more details can be found at http://www.thescandals.com/index.cfm.\n\nAnderson made four attempts to talk on his cellular telephone to the pilot and his flight attendants about the impact on them, the trial heard. Both said they could see the jet coming up in the direction of the plane landing, but said they did not see anything before the skid hit the ground.\n\nThe pilot said he could see the crash coming from his seat, while the passenger said she could have seen the plane coming up in her seat from the bottom of the windshield.\n\nKaren O. Koehl, 42, of Hoboken, New Jersey, and her teenage daughter, Kia H. Koehl, 9, of Hoboken, New Jersey, died when the Piper Super Cub jet skid they were sitting in struck the jet.\n\nBoth women were members of a family that had flown with Piper airplanes at the Hudson Valley Airport, the airport said.\n\nAnderson's attorney had asked for a two- and four-year sentence, and his lawyer called the crash \"the most horrific thing a pilot could do in his life.\""
