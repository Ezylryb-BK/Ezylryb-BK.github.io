  My developer is trying to convince me to move to .net from PHP. I have always
  disliked the idea because of the costs. But he's tryiong none the less. I've
  been using Movable-type on numerous websites for about a year and am anxious
  about switching to another platform. I have heard very good things about
  blogengine.net. Is there a way I can import all my wordpress posts into it?
  Any help would be really appreciated!|  а
