message: "First off I want to say awesome blog! I had a quick \r\nquestion that I'd like to ask if you don't mind. I was interested to find out how \r\nyou center yourself and clear your thoughts before writing.\r\nI have had trouble clearing my thoughts in getting my ideas out.\r\nI truly do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes tend to be lost simply just trying to figure out how to begin. \r\nAny suggestions or tips? Cheers!"
