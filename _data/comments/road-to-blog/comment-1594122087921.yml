message: "Rudds new team's coach will have to be the man who delivers that best of all worlds statement â€“ who embodies that genuine, team spirit. He will have to know the culture, and the players would understand him. I'd like to hear what this means for the players over the next 12 months.\n\nI was just sitting in a lunchroom with my girlfriend and said to her to stop this and take back to the officeâ€¦ it's a great team spirit. That said, our culture â€“ this team is so much about the spirit of our players â€“ I think that's part of a great team. The spirit and passion of that team, that's what makes them successful. It's not just a few people who work in there who are good at everything. It's a group of people with a certain level of passion and drive who work incredibly hard, and you're seeing a lot of that at Sydney Roosters this year.\n\nIf I said, 'We'll sign someone on as a coach for the rest of their career', then you can be sure that the Roosters players would look at that and say, 'That's insane.'\n\nYou can't say you're bringing in somebody to change it â€“ you can't change anything like that. If you did that, that's madness. You've got the best in the competition, your team, it's not like they're saying, 'Oh you're not worth this contract' for the next 10 years. That's insane to me.\n\nIt's great to have a guy who has done that at the Roosters â€“ he really brings a unique flavour that's very different than what we are normally shown at clubs. He's a player's coach. And I've met him before, we were discussing what sort of man he'd be to coach Roosters football â€“ the sort of coach that would be more focused on his players' well-being than he was on a lot of people's egos, maybe.\n\nHe said the only advice he gives is to get out there and live for the football club and play hard.\n\nHe's been a great ambassador for the club, his professionalism means he could walk into any club and not have an issue about going, 'I've got a contract here, let's sign that and get back to basics.'\n\nI was just sitting in a lunchroom with my girlfriend and said to her to stop this and take back to the officeâ€¦ it's a great team spirit.

This means that a quarter of its 2013 total budget deficit of 6.2 billion rubles ($14 billion) will still be present this year, with the government facing an immediate fiscal squeeze."
