  First of all I want to say awesome blog! I had a quick question in which I'd
  like to ask if you don't mind. I was interested to find out how you center
  yourself and clear your mind before writing. I've had difficulty clearing my
  thoughts in getting my thoughts out. I do take pleasure in writing however it
  just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes are wasted simply just trying to
  figure out how to begin. Any recommendations or tips? Appreciate it!|  а
