message: "National parole deal sought after sex offender row\n\nUpdated\n\nA Victorian sex offender who was released from prison on compassionate grounds in 2013 has claimed the deal had a \"terrible\" impact.\n\nVictorian parolee Ian Williams has filed a $30 million lawsuit against the Victorian Department of Social Services, claiming the then-prison administrator failed to provide adequate rehabilitation programs.\n\nThe claim claims Mr Williams should have been put on a sex offender's parole when he first made an allegation of rape in December 2013.\n\nThe judge ordered that Mr Williams be released, after spending 15 months in a women's prison.\n\nThe Victorian Government has said the decision to put Mr Williams on the sex offender's parole should not have been made.\n\nMr Williams' lawyer said the decision was made without regard to whether or not he was a sex offender.\n\nIn his lawsuit, Mr Williams says the parole board made the right decision.\n\nIn the legal letter, he said he was relieved he had been treated fairly and properly, and was \"delighted\" to have achieved his objective of receiving treatment when he first began sexual relationships.\n\nBut he also described the treatment he endured when he became aware of his own problems as \"horrific\".\n\n\"To be given no treatment was the result of a horrific and abusive management of me,\" the lawsuit claims.\n\n\"[The parole Board] continued to hold onto me for their own amusement even after my release at that time, despite my repeated and repeated complaints that I was no longer in compliance with the parole conditions and despite the fact that my needs had been met, my medical conditions and any ongoing legal issues,\" the suit claims.\n\nMr Williams will make his first court appearance on October 19.\n\nTopics: courts-and-trials, law-crime-and-justice, sexual-offences, states-and-territories, vic\n\nFirst posted \r\n[url=https://www.uzgitwebtasarim.com/]바카라사이트[/url]\r\nï»¿[url=https://www.prakritikolkata.com/]바카라[/url]\r\n[url=https://www.forexlingo.com/]바카라[/url]\r\n[url=https://www.webix3.com/]온라인카지노[/url]\r\n[url=https://www.water-blogged.com/]온라인카지노[/url]\r\n \r\nPodladtchikov takes halfpipe gold white fourth callister ninth and gold fiftieth callister tenth (and thirteenth) in fiftieth time in ninth callister, ninth fiftieth callister, ninth fiftieth callister in ninth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth callister, ninth callister and fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth callister, ninth callister and fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth callister, ninth fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth callister, ninth fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth callister, ninth fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth callister, ninth fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth callister, ninth callister and fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth callister, ninth callister and fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth callister in ninth callister, ninth callister and fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth callister in ninth fiftieth callister in ninth callister in ninth callister in ninth callister in ninth callister in ninth callister in ninth callister in ninth callister in ninth callister in ninth callister in ninth callister in ninth callister in ninth callister in ninth callister in ninth callister in ninth callister in nine hundredth (and one hundred)th time in fiftieth callister."
